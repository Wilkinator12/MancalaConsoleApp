The Mancala Console App

This is a Console application that simulates the board game "Mancala". It uses a SQLite database to track players, their number of wins, and active games that they are currently in. Games that are active are automatically saved after each turn and can be reloaded when the program restarts.


Current Features:
- Add and remove players
- Check out the leaderboard to see which players have the most wins
- Play through games on the same computer
- Games are automatically saved once created and after each turn so they can be reloaded each time the program starts


What is Mancala?

Mancala is a board game that predates chess. It may even be as old as agriculture itself. Each player has six "cups" each that start with four seeds in them and their own "home cup" which starts with zero seeds. The goal is to get more seeds in your home cup than the other player.
